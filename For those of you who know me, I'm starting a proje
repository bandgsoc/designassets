For those of you who know me, I'm starting a project and need a rhythm section, horns, and a mc/singer. 
If you have free time for another group (1 rehearsal/1-2 weeks and 1-3 gigs/month to start), 
hit me up and I'll tell you about it.

For those of you who don't:
My name is Ben, I'm a tuba player. 
You've never heard the tuba do what I do to it.
What does that mean? 
Basically I beat box and play really f*cking fast, and play styles of music never meant for the tuba.

I've worked in the music industry for many years, and have a ton of inside knowledge to get the group off the ground.
I've worked PR for 3 labels and worked at some of the best recording studios in the world. 
I've played in a ton of groups from as many genres, and love to try new music.

I'm starting a hip hop project, and I need some hungry musicians who want to try something new.

All walks of life, age, race, gender and sexuality preferred.

No prior experience necessary, but know that I'll expect professional demeanor and musicianship from a player.

Pay will come with gigs, but I will pay for your gas to get to rehearsals to start.

This is a project I've been chewing on for almost a decade, and it's time to make it happen.

Hit me up at brassandgoldsociety@gmail.com or PM me and let's make something awesome.
